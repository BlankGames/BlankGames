## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**BlankGames/BlankGames** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2D animations for YT, an MMO starter zone in UE5 and modeling a Cathedral in Blender for it (all inspired by the prologue of FF14), and trying to do the splits for the first time. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Blender, UE5, and how to animate in 2D.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on learning experiences to master the current skills I'm persuing, but preferably through the use of fan or inspired creations/passion-projects (am currently a huge Kid Icarus fan, that's what got me started with all this actually, I even modded the game on 3DS :D)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with animations in Clip Studio Paint EX through the teamwork function, the UE5 game I mentioned, and just people to frequently share their progress in their own separate or shared interests that they use their ability to create as a tool to explore the things that they are already a fan of, even if they are only a fan of a potential possibility, because since if anything is possible, the presence of that existence belongs as apart of reality, not just after it materialises through physical creation - which is the mentality needed in order to have the spirit capable of bringing dreams to life in the first place.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about something fun you want to do together :D
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My Discord Server - https://discord.gg/A8cr85fVhH
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Gigalomaniac
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm trying to increase my focus through an extreme challenege of no music, meaning not even in the background of video games, anime, or youtube videos. So, I have only been playing rayman legends on mute, haven't watched anime, and only watch boring/unedited tutorial videos for the past [5 Days]
